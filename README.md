Here is a pokedex application made with javascript, HTML, and CSS with handlebars
included. I wanted to build an application that would be game inspired as I am interested
in entering the game industry after completing the Software Immersive program.

This app allows you to sign up and sign in with an email and password. After signing in you change interact with the pokedex by creating, updating, deleting and getting all the pokemon
you created in the application.

This project unfortunately didn not meet requirements in it's first iteration.
All forms do not clear as asked and the DELETE button still needs a message saying a
pokemon was deleted from the users pokedex.

Here is the link to the database which was built with Ruby on Rails. Rails allowed me
to generate all of my required files by scaffolding.
