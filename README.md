Here is the front end client for the pokedex application. This app was made with javascript, HTML, and CSS with handlebars.

 I wanted to build an application that would be game inspired as I am interested
in pursuing a career in the game industry after completing the Software Immersive program.

This app allows you to sign up and sign in with an email and password. After signing in you can interact with the pokedex by creating, updating, deleting and getting all the pokemon
you created in the application.

In future iterations of this project I plan on improving the design so it emulates the design of the pokedex used in the cartoon "Pokemon". As well as the design of the application I
will add a feature where the user can search for a single pokemon by name and the app will
find that pokemon by id and retrieve the data for the user with a picture of the pokemon and a description of the pokemon in the middle of the application.

Here is the link to the database which was built with Ruby on Rails. Rails allowed me
to generate all of my required files by scaffolding. An interesting feature of this app is
the ability to retrieve data from a single user. If a user has signed up they can only access and modify their data and cannot see other users data.  I added this feature by assigning
the controller to 'Protected Controller' in Ruby.
